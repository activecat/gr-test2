Custom blocks available in this module:

1).  "pulse1" (source block) for demonstrating how to use "Sample Rate" in out-of-tree module.
     Refer examples/flowgraph_01.grc and flowgraph_02.grc

     This is for answering question at http://gnuradio.4.n7.nabble.com/sampling-rate-of-a-customized-signal-source-td48649.html


2).  "freq_counter2" (sync block) for counting frequency of incoming signal.
